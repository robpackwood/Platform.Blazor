Repositories could be specified in the DAL in order to be grouped together. 

For example in model.xml
  LegalParty 
  LegalPartyRole

Both tables above could have a new attribute called "LegalPartyRepository"

The repositories could be then generated as partial classes and partial interfaces 
and read the effective dating type attribute to generate methods to retrieve data by effective date
and also wire up the CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE methods to the existing generated stored procs.

Additional methods can then be manually added to the partial class and interface as needed.
